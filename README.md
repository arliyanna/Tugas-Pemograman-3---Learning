# Tugas-Pemograman-3---Learning

**1. Task Description**


   Given a traintest.xlsx file consisting of two sheets: train and test, which contains the dataset for the binary classification problem. Each record or row of data in the dataset consists of generally consists of data row number (𝑖𝑑), input features (𝑥1 to 𝑥3), and output class (𝑦). Features consists of integer values in a certain range for each feature. While the output class is binary (0 or 1).

The train sheet contains 296 rows of data, complete with the target output class (𝑦). Use this sheet for modeling stage or training the model according to the method you are using. The test sheet contains 10 rows of data, with the output class (𝑦) hidden. Use this sheet for the testing of the trained model. Later, the output of your program for this test data will be matched with the target or real class.

**Choice of methods you can use (choose one)**
-  Decision Tree (ID3)
-  KNN
-  Naïve Bayes

**The process that you have to implement into the program (can be a function/procedure):**
-  Reading the training/test data
-  Training the model
-  Saving the training model
-  Testing the model
-  Model evaluation
-  Saving output to file

**2. Output Program**
   Your program generally has two stages: training and testing. In the training stage, the output is a model based on the method you used. Whereas in the testing stage, the output is the class (0 or 1); furthermore, if there is more than one record/row as input data for the testing stage, then the program can output a list of outputs in the form of records/rows as input data for the testing stage, then the program can output a list of output class that corresponds to each row of testing data.
